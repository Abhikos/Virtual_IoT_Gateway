== Content
This repository contains the material build for the 2016 Red Hat Summit.

The following sub-projects have been created

* https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Summit_Lab/tree/master/Software_Sensor[Software Sensors]: a software sensor who could can be used to simulate sensor data creation.
* https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Summit_Lab/tree/master/BusinessRulesService[Rules Service]: a service which receives data from a defined AMQ-Queue, validates those against Business Rules and drops the results in another defined AMQ-Queue
* https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Summit_Lab/tree/master/RoutingService[Routing Service]: the service who receives, transforms and routes messages from one destination to the next.

== Lab 0 - Preparing the Lab Environment
If you should do these labs on an environment, which was not prepared for it,
please follow the https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Summit_Lab/blob/master/BuildVM.adoc[instructions] on how to setup a lab environment.

== Lab 1 - Installing Red Hat JBoss Fuse
In our lab environment, we do need to have a running instance of
Red Hat JBoss Fuse. To install this, please perform the following steps

* Login to you lab-environment with

 username = 'demo-user'
 password = 'change12_me'

* Open a terminal

* In the shell perform the following steps

 [demo-user@localhost ~]$ cd
 [demo-user@localhost ~]$ unzip jboss-fuse-full-6.2.1.redhat-084.zip
 [demo-user@localhost ~]$ ln -s jboss-fuse-6.2.1.redhat-084 fuse

* Close the shell

 [demo-user@localhost ~]$ exit

These simple steps complete the installation of Red Hat JBoss Fuse.

== Lab 2 - Starting JBoss Fuse
We will start the JBoss Fuse server and will leave it running in the background. Deployment
to the server will be done "hot", which is definately not a best-practice, but
for the sake of this lab, it's absolutely sufficient.

To start JBoss Fuse, please follow these simple steps

 * Open a new shell, as described in the previous section
 * Enter the following commands

  [demo-user@localhost ~]$ cd
  [demo-user@localhost ~]$ cd IoT_Summit_Lab
  [demo-user@iotlab IoT_Summit_Lab]$ ./runJBossFuse.sh

* Wait for the Red Hat JBoss Fuse to complete the start procedure

* To be able to process MQTT messages, Red Hat JBoss Fuse needs to install the
'camel-mqtt' OSGi features. To to this, enter the following simple command on the
'JBossFuse' command prompt

 JBossFuse:karaf@root> features:install camel-mqtt

* Minimize this shell, as we don't need it at the moment
