== Scope
This document is intended for those people who would like to perform the
IoT-Lab, as described in this repository.

The instructions are based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux V7.2 (RHEL) but can easily be
re-done on other Operatingsystems, if you have the basic skills to install
software, etc.

In the course of this document, we will assume that you will run RHEL in a VM, but
bare metal deployments will work as well.

== Pre-Requisite
You will need to install a RHEL V7.2 with

 * 2 CPUs
 * 4 GB RAM ( more is always good )
 * 20GB Storage with

During the installation please select to install the server with GUI.

For simplicity we will use the default setting for the disk partitions.

Also make sure that your network is activated.

I usually create a user called "demo-user" with admin rights, but you can call
your user whatever you want.

After completing the install precedure, please make sure to register your RHEL
installation and bring it to the most current level via

 yum upgrade

== Additional Installations
To be able to run the demo-labs, you will need the following products/packages
installed:

=== Additional RHEL packages
To install additional RHEL packages, please perform the following steps

 [demo-user@iotlab Desktop]$ sudo subscription-manager repos --enable="rhel-7-server-rpms"  --enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms"  --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.0-rpms"
 [demo-user@iotlab Desktop]$ sudo yum -y install java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel wget git unzip ansible docker
 [sudo] password for demo-user:

To make 'docker' available to non-'root' user, please perform the following steps

 [demo-user@iotlab Desktop]$ sudo groupadd docker
 [demo-user@iotlab Desktop]$ sudo usermod -g docker demo-user
 [demo-user@iotlab Desktop]$ sudo systemctl start docker
 [demo-user@iotlab Desktop]$ sudo systemctl enable docker

 === Installing Maven
 For the builds to work automatically, we need to install Apache Maven. Please do
 so by performing the following steps

  [demo-user@iotlab Desktop]$ cd
  [demo-user@iotlab ~]$ wget http://mirror.softaculous.com/apache/maven/maven-3/3.3.9/binaries/apache-maven-3.3.9-bin.zip
--2016-05-17 17:17:03--  http://mirror.softaculous.com/apache/maven/maven-3/3.3.9/binaries/apache-maven-3.3.9-bin.zip
  [demo-user@iotlab ~]$ unzip apache-maven-3.3.9-bin.zip
  [demo-user@iotlab ~]$ sudo ln -s /opt/maven/bin/mvn /usr/bin/mvn

Now please create a file called '/etc/profile.d/maven.sh' with the following content

 #!/bin/bash
 MAVEN_HOME=/opt/maven
 PATH=$MAVEN_HOME/bin:$PATH
 export PATH MAVEN_HOME
 export CLASSPATH=.

And again, run the following commands

 [demo-user@iotlab ~]$ sudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/maven.sh
 [demo-user@iotlab ~]$ source /etc/profile.d/maven.sh

== Getting the Red Hat Products
As for the writing of these instructions, Red Hat JBoss Fuse has been released
in Version 6.2.1

Please download this version from the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html?product=jboss.fuse&downloadType=distributions[Red Hat Customer Portal]

After downloading it, please place the file 'jboss-fuse-full-6.2.1.redhat-084.zip'
into the home-directory of your user. In my case the command required is

 [demo-user@iotlab ~]$ mv Downloads/jboss-fuse-full-6.2.1.redhat-084.zip /home/demo-user

== Getting the Lab-Code and instructions
To clone the IoT-Lab exercises into your system, please perform the following
steps

 [demo-user@iotlab ~]$ cd
 [demo-user@iotlab ~]$ git clone https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Summit_Lab
